            2. I have absolutely no knowledge of CS/web design, so I'm taking this class because I want to have some foundational knowledge that could be useful in the future. Also, this class is a requirement XD

            5. Well for one, a screen can be various sizes- and can even change within a frame. The way we interact with screens is also different than how we do on paper. We have to keep this in mind as designers.

            6. This might be a super basic answer, but I really like Apple's website https://www.apple.com/ I think the way everything is set up is user-friendly, simple, and straightforward. It also aligns with the clean and simple aesthetic Apple has for its products.

            7. I think https://www.hydroflask.com/ has solid communication. It shows the products, how much they cost, what colors it comes in, and has supporting images. The user can see exactly what they will get.

            8. A website that works well is https://www.youtube.com/ because it's easy to navigate, it curates things for you, and it's simple- made for everyone.
