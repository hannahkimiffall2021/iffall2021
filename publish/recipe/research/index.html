            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 8x8 baking pan with butter and line with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Next brown your butter. Heat unsalted butter over high heat until all the butter has melted. Then lower the heat to low and cook until brown bits start to appear. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Next add white chocolate to a small bowl. Sift in the matcha powder. Pour the browned butter over the top until a uniform green ganache appears. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Combine grandulated sugar, light brown sugar, eggs, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer to whisk the mixture until it is thick and cream (5-10 minutes). </li>
                <li>While mixing, stream in your matcha chocolate ganache. Whisk until a uniform green mixture appears.</li>
                <li>Lastly, sift your flour into the bowl. Using a spatula, gently fold the flour into the green mixture. Be careful not to deflate the batter too much. Mix until just combined. Spoon the batter into your prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Bake brownies for 20-30 minutes. After 20 minutes, take out the brownies and smack the pan onto a flat surface to get rid of some of the air bubbles.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle some flaky salt on top and put them back in the oven. Bake for another 10 minutes. Let brownies cool for 20 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>

            <ul>
                <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/">https://www.simplyrecipes.com/</a>
                <p>I like this website because I feel it organizes the recipe well. It has tips and tricks in the beginning nearby the story portion of the site, then it has the recipe indicated in a different section with a different color. That being said, it seems like it's set up more for mobile sites, because it is really vertical and requires a lot of scrolling.</p>
                <a href="https://everydayannie.com/2017/05/11/blackberry-layer-cake/">https://everydayannie.com</a>
                <p>This website is extremely simple, but as a result straightforward and easy to follow. Perhaps, this intent is to show how simple the recipes themselves are.</p>
                <a href="https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/">https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/</a>
                <p>I like how this website is left aligned and how the important aspects are also on the left. The right side doesn't feel extremely bare because it is filled with other elements, which I appreciate. </p>

                <p>I really like this aesthetic and the simple shapes the site uses to show their products. The way they place images with the text looks nice as well.</p>

                <p>This website is kinda crazy, but I think it's really really cool. I really like the typeface they chose, and the site itself tells a story, which is something a recipe website can do, too.</p>

                <p>I like how this website has scrolling horizontal, and I think that can help remedy the common thing of super veritcal nature of recipe websites.</p>
