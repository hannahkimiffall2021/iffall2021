            <div>
                <p>When the rain is blowing in your face</p>
                <p>And the whole world is on your case</p>
                <p>I could offer you a warm embrace</p>
                <p>To make you feel my love</p>

        <main>
            <div>
                <p>When the evening shadows and the stars appear</p>
                <p>And there is no one there to dry your tears</p>
                <p>I could hold you for a million years</p>
                <p>To make you feel my love</p>
            </div>

        <main>
            <div>
                <p>I know you haven't made your mind up yet</p>
                <p>But I will never do you wrong</p>
                <p>I've known it from the moment that we met</p>
                <p>No doubt in my mind where you belong</p>
            </div>
        </main>

        <main>
            <div>
                <p>I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue</p>
                <p>I'd go crawling down the avenue</p>
                <p>No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do</p>
                <p>To make you feel my love</p>

        <main>
            <div>
                <p>The storms are raging on the rolling sea</p>
                <p>And on the highway of regret</p>
                <p>The winds of change are blowing wild and free</p>
                <p>You ain't seen nothing like me yet  </p>
            </div>
        </main>
            <p>

            </p>
        <main>
            <div>
                <p>I could make you happy, make your dreams come true</p>
                <p>Nothing that I wouldn't do</p>
                <p>Go to the ends of the Earth for you</p>
                <p>To make you feel my love</p>
                <p>To make you feel my love</p>
            </div>
